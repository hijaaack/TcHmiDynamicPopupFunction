## TcHmiDynamicPopupFunction
In version 1.12.760.x a new TcHmiPopup control was added to TwinCAT HMI. 

So instead of having to add the Popup manually to the view/content this sample is dynamically creating a usercontrol by calling a javascript function and it will have the same look & feel as the new TcHmiPopup.
